\section{Introduction}
The work predicts simulated Pokémon battle outcomes using an optimized Stacking Ensemble architecture. The winning approach leveraged: Feature Engineering (17 non-redundant strategic signals); Diverse base models for linear/non-linear relationships; and a meticulously calibrated Tier-1 Meta-Model for optimal prediction aggregation.
