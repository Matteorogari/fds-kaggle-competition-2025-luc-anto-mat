\section{Introduction}
The work predicts simulated Pokémon battle outcomes using an optimized Stacking Ensemble architecture. The winning approach leveraged: 1) Feature Engineering (17 non-redundant strategic signals); 2) Diverse base models for linear/non-linear relationships; and 3) A meticulously calibrated Tier-1 Meta-Model for optimal prediction aggregation.
