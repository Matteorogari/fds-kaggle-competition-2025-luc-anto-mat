\section{Introduction}

The prediction of complex battle outcomes, based on partially observed final states and static power metrics, is a fundamental challenge in statistical modeling. 
The competition focused on estimating the outcome of simulated Pokémon battles, an environment where the result is determined by a complex interplay of game state, team composition, and strategic advantage.

Throughout the competition, three main modeling architectures were explored, all centered on optimizing the \textbf{Stacking Ensemble} approach. 
The analysis presented here addresses three key methodological requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the engineering of varying feature sets to represent battle state and static team differences;
    \item the selection of diverse \textbf{Tier-0} base models capable of capturing relationships both linear and non-linear;
    \item the meticulous calibration of a \textbf{Tier-1} Meta-Model for optimal combination of predictions.
\end{itemize}

This report demonstrates the effectiveness of the 17-feature approach in providing non-redundant strategic signals, which proved essential for the final aggregated model's performance.
