This report analyzes the machine learning methodologies developed for the Pokémon Battle Prediction competition.
The problem is modeled as a binary classification task to estimate Player 1's victory probability, based on three systematically varied sets of input features. 
The core approach across all implementations is a Two-Level Stacking Ensemble, which leverages the complementarity between linear predictors (Logistic Regression) and boosting models (XGBoost, HGBT). 
The results strongly demonstrate that integrating domain-specific metrics, specifically those that quantify strategic type advantage and residual in-battle power, is essential for maximizing predictive reliability.
